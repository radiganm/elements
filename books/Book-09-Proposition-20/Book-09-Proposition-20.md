## Proposition 20

The (set of all) prime numbers is more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers.

Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be the assigned prime numbers.  I say the (set of all) prime numbers is more numerous than $A$, $B$, $C$.

For let the least number measured by $A$, $B$, $C$ have been taken, and let it be $DE$ [Prop. 7.36].  And let the unit $DF$ have been added to $DE$.  So $EF$ is either prime or not.  Let it, first of all, be prime.  Thus, the (set of) prime numbers $A$, $B$, $C$, $EF$, (which is) more numerous than $A$, $B$, $C#, has been found.

And so let $EF$ be not prime.  Thus, it is measured by some prime (number) [Prop. 7.31].  Let it be measured by the prime number $G$.  I say that $G$ is not the same number as any of $A$, $B$, $C$.  For, if possible, let it be (the same).  And $A$, $B$, $C$ (all) measure $DE$.  Thus, $G$ will also measure $DE$.  And it also measured $EF$.  (So) $G$ will also measure the remainder, unit $DF$ (despite) being a number [Prop. 7.28].  The very thing (is) absurd.  Thus, $G$ is not the same as one of $A$, $B$, $C$.  And it was assumed (to be) prime.  Thus, the (set of) prime numbers $A$, $B$, $C$, $G$, (which is) more numerous than the assigned multitude (of prime numbers), $A$, $B$, $C$, has been found.  (Which is) the very thing it was required to show. $\square$
