## Proposition 2

To place a straight-line equal to a given straight-line at a given point (as an extremity).
Let $A$ be the given point, $BC$ the given straight-line.  So it is required to place a straight-line at point $A$ equal to the given straight-line $BC$.

For let the straight-line $AB$ have been jointed from point $A$ to point $B$, and let the euqilateral triangle $DAB$ have been constructed upon it  And let the straight-lines $AE$ and $BF$ have been produced in a straight-line with $DA$ and $DB$ (repectively).  And let the circle $GCH$ with center $B$ and radius $BC$ have been drawn, and again let the circle $GKL$ with center D and radius $DG$ have been drawn.

Therefore, since the point $B$ is the center (of the circle) $GCH$, $BC$ is equal to $BG$.  Again, since the point $D$ is the center of the circle $GKL$, $DL$ is equal to $DG$.  And within these, $DA$ is equal to $DB$.  Thus, the remainder $AL$ is equal to the remainder $BG$.  But $BC$ ws shown (to be) equal to $BG$.  Thus, $AL$ and $BC$ are each euqal to $BG$.  But things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.  Thus, $AL$ is also equal to $BC$.

Thus, the straight-line $AL$, equal to the given straight-line $BC$, has been placed at the point $A$.  (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.  $\square$
