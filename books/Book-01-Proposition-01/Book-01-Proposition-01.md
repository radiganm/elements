## Proposition 1

To construct an equilateral triangle on a given finite straight-line.

\includegraphics{figures/Book-01-Proposition-01-1}

Let $AB$ be the given finite straight line.

So it is required to contruct an equilateral triangle on the straight-line AB.

Let the circle $BCD$ with center $A$ and radius $AB$ have been drawn, and again let the circle $ACE$ with center $B$ and radius $BA$ have been drawn.  And let the straight-lines $CA$ and $CB$ have been joined from the point $C$, where the circles cut one another, to the points $A$ and $B$ (repsectively). $\square$
